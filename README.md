# Kii push sample in ionic2.

This sample demostrates how to crete application using Kii Cloud with ionic2.
We focus on utilize push notification in this sample.

## Push plugin
The sample is built with
[phonegap-plugin-push](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push).

We also have
[kii-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/KiiPlatform/kii-cordova-plugin).
However `kii-cordova-plugin` doesn't support silent push handling/ customizing
notification.
If you plan to implement those features, using `phonegap-plugin-push` would be
better choice.

## Preparation
TODO: write.
